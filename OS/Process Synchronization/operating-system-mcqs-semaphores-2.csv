1,What will happen if a non-recursive mutex is locked more than once?,"['a) Starvation', 'b) Deadlock', 'c) Aging', 'd) Signaling']",a) Starvation,b) Deadlock,c) Aging,d) Signaling,b,"If a thread which had already locked a mutex, tries to lock the mutex again, it will enter into the waiting list of that mutex, which results in a deadlock. It is because no other thread can unlock the mutex."
2,What is a semaphore?,"['a) is a binary mutex', 'b) must be accessed from only one process', 'c) can be accessed from multiple processes', 'd) none of the mentioned']",a) is a binary mutex,b) must be accessed from only one process,c) can be accessed from multiple processes,d) none of the mentioned,c,None.
3,What are the two kinds of semaphores?,"['a) mutex & counting', 'b) binary & counting', 'c) counting & decimal', 'd) decimal & binary']",a) mutex & counting,b) binary & counting,c) counting & decimal,d) decimal & binary,b,None.
4,What is a mutex?,"['a) is a binary mutex', 'b) must be accessed from only one process', 'c) can be accessed from multiple processes', 'd) none of the mentioned']",a) is a binary mutex,b) must be accessed from only one process,c) can be accessed from multiple processes,d) none of the mentioned,b,None.
5,At a particular time of computation the value of a counting semaphore is 7,"['a) 42', 'b) 2', 'c) 7', 'd) 12']",a) 42,b) 2,c) 7,d) 12,b,P represents Wait and V represents Signal. P operation will decrease the value by 1 every time and V operation will increase the value by 1 every time.
6,A binary semaphore is a semaphore with integer values ____________,"['a) 1', 'b) -1', 'c) 0.8', 'd) 0.5']",a) 1,b) -1,c) 0.8,d) 0.5,a,None.
X is set to 5 before either process begins execution,"As usual, statements within a process are executed sequentially, but statements in process A may execute in any order with respect to statements in process B","['How many different values of X are possible after both processes finish executing?', 'a) two', 'b) three', 'c) four']",How many different values of X are possible after both processes finish executing?,a) two,b) three,c) four,c,Here are the possible ways in which statements from A and B can be interleaved.
"T is set to 0 before either process begins execution and, as before, X is set to 5",,"['Now, how many different values of X are possible after both processes finish executing?', 'a) one', 'b) two', 'c) three']","Now, how many different values of X are possible after both processes finish executing?",a) one,b) two,c) three,a,The semaphore T ensures that all the statements from A finish execution before B begins. So now there is only one way in which statements from A and B can be interleaved:
9,Semaphores are mostly used to implement ____________,"['a) System calls', 'b) IPC mechanisms', 'c) System protection', 'd) None of the mentioned']",a) System calls,b) IPC mechanisms,c) System protection,d) None of the mentioned,b,None.
10,Spinlocks are intended to provide __________ only,"['a) Mutual Exclusion', 'b) Bounded Waiting', 'c) Aging', 'd) Progress']",a) Mutual Exclusion,b) Bounded Waiting,c) Aging,d) Progress,b,None.
