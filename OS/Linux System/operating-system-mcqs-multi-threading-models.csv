1,The model in which one kernel thread is mapped to many user-level threads is called ___________,"['a) Many to One model', 'b) One to Many model', 'c) Many to Many model', 'd) One to One model']",a) Many to One model,b) One to Many model,c) Many to Many model,d) One to One model,a,None.
2,The model in which one user-level thread is mapped to many kernel level threads is called ___________,"['a) Many to One model', 'b) One to Many model', 'c) Many to Many model', 'd) One to One model']",a) Many to One model,b) One to Many model,c) Many to Many model,d) One to One model,b,None.
3,"In the Many to One model, if a thread makes a blocking system call ___________","['a) the entire process will be blocked', 'b) a part of the process will stay blocked, with the rest running', 'c) the entire process will run', 'd) none of the mentioned']",a) the entire process will be blocked,"b) a part of the process will stay blocked, with the rest running",c) the entire process will run,d) none of the mentioned,a,None.
4,"In the Many to One model, multiple threads are unable to run in parallel on multiprocessors because of ___________","['a) only one thread can access the kernel at a time', 'b) many user threads have access to just one kernel thread', 'c) there is only one kernel thread', 'd) none of the mentioned']",a) only one thread can access the kernel at a time,b) many user threads have access to just one kernel thread,c) there is only one kernel thread,d) none of the mentioned,a,None.
5,The One to One model allows ___________,"['a) increased concurrency', 'b) decreased concurrency', 'c) increased or decreased concurrency', 'd) concurrency equivalent to other models']",a) increased concurrency,b) decreased concurrency,c) increased or decreased concurrency,d) concurrency equivalent to other models,a,None.
6,In the One to One model when a thread makes a blocking system call ___________,"['a) other threads are strictly prohibited from running', 'b) other threads are allowed to run', 'c) other threads only from other processes are allowed to run', 'd) none of the mentioned']",a) other threads are strictly prohibited from running,b) other threads are allowed to run,c) other threads only from other processes are allowed to run,d) none of the mentioned,b,None.
7,Which of the following is the drawback of the One to One Model?,"['a) increased concurrency provided by this model', 'b) decreased concurrency provided by this model', 'c) creating so many threads at once can crash the system', 'd) creating a user thread requires creating the corresponding kernel thread']",a) increased concurrency provided by this model,b) decreased concurrency provided by this model,c) creating so many threads at once can crash the system,d) creating a user thread requires creating the corresponding kernel thread,d,None.
8,When is the Many to One model at an advantage?,"['a) When the program does not need multithreading', 'b) When the program has to be multi-threaded', 'c) When there is a single processor', 'd) None of the mentioned']",a) When the program does not need multithreading,b) When the program has to be multi-threaded,c) When there is a single processor,d) None of the mentioned,a,None.
9,In the Many to Many model true concurrency cannot be gained because ___________,"['a) the kernel can schedule only one thread at a time', 'b) there are too many threads to handle', 'c) it is hard to map threads with each other', 'd) none of the mentioned']",a) the kernel can schedule only one thread at a time,b) there are too many threads to handle,c) it is hard to map threads with each other,d) none of the mentioned,a,None.
10,In the Many to Many models when a thread performs a blocking system call ___________,"['a) other threads are strictly prohibited from running', 'b) other threads are allowed to run', 'c) other threads only from other processes are allowed to run', 'd) none of the mentioned']",a) other threads are strictly prohibited from running,b) other threads are allowed to run,c) other threads only from other processes are allowed to run,d) none of the mentioned,b,None.
