1,What is the preferred way of encryption?,"['a) pre shared secret key', 'b) using key distribution center (KDC)', 'c) public key-encryption', 'd) symmetric key']",a) pre shared secret key,b) using key distribution center (KDC),c) public key-encryption,d) symmetric key,c,Pre Shared key can be compromised and either party can be suspected. Likewise KDC or symmetric key can have breach which are undesirable. Public and private key encryption is a known industry standard.
2,What is not a role of encryption?,"['a) It is used to protect data from unauthorized access during transmission', 'b) It is used to ensure user authentication', 'c) It is used to ensure data integrity', 'd) It is used to ensure data corruption doesn’t happens']",a) It is used to protect data from unauthorized access during transmission,b) It is used to ensure user authentication,c) It is used to ensure data integrity,d) It is used to ensure data corruption doesn’t happens,d,Encryption doesn’t have error correction or detection facility thus cannot be used to safeguard from data corruption.
3,What is cipher-block chaining?,"['a) Data is logically ‘ANDed’ with previous block', 'b) Data is logically ‘ORed’ with previous block', 'c) Data is logically ‘XORed’ with previous block', 'd) None of the mentioned']",a) Data is logically ‘ANDed’ with previous block,b) Data is logically ‘ORed’ with previous block,c) Data is logically ‘XORed’ with previous block,d) None of the mentioned,c,None.
4,What is not an encryption standard?,"['a) AES', 'b) TES', 'c) Triple DES', 'd) DES']",a) AES,b) TES,c) Triple DES,d) DES,b,None.
5,Which of the following is not a stream cipher?,"['a) Two fish', 'b) RC5', 'c) RC4', 'd) TBONE']",a) Two fish,b) RC5,c) RC4,d) TBONE,d,None.
6,What is a Hash Function?,"['a) It creates a small flexible block of data', 'b) It creates a small,fixed block of data', 'c) It creates a encrypted block of data', 'd) None of the mentioned']",a) It creates a small flexible block of data,"b) It creates a small,fixed block of data",c) It creates a encrypted block of data,d) None of the mentioned,b,None.
7,MD5 produces __________ bits hash data,"['a) 128', 'b) 150', 'c) 160', 'd) 112']",a) 128,b) 150,c) 160,d) 112,a,None.
8,SHA-1 produces __________ bit of hash,"['a) 128', 'b) 160', 'c) 150', 'd) 112']",a) 128,b) 160,c) 150,d) 112,b,None.
9,Which two of the following are authentication algorithms?,"['a) MAC', 'b) AES', 'c) DAS', 'd) Digital-signature']",a) MAC,b) AES,c) DAS,d) Digital-signature,a,None.
10,What is the role of Key Distribution Center?,"['a) It is used to distribute keys to everyone in world', 'b) It intended to reduce the risks inherent in exchanging keys', 'c) All of the mentioned', 'd) None of the mentioned']",a) It is used to distribute keys to everyone in world,b) It intended to reduce the risks inherent in exchanging keys,c) All of the mentioned,d) None of the mentioned,b,None.
