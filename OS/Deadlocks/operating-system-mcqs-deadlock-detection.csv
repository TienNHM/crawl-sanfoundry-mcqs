5,What is the disadvantage of invoking the detection algorithm for every request?,"['a) overhead of the detection algorithm due to consumption of memory', 'b) excessive time consumed in the request to be allocated memory', 'c) considerable overhead in computation time', 'd) all of the mentioned']",a) overhead of the detection algorithm due to consumption of memory,b) excessive time consumed in the request to be allocated memory,c) considerable overhead in computation time,d) all of the mentioned,c,None.
6,A deadlock eventually cripples system throughput and will cause the CPU utilization to ______,"['a) increase', 'b) drop', 'c) stay still', 'd) none of the mentioned']",a) increase,b) drop,c) stay still,d) none of the mentioned,b,None.
7,"Every time a request for allocation cannot be granted immediately, the detection algorithm is invoked","['a) the set of processes that have been deadlocked', 'b) the set of processes in the deadlock queue', 'c) the specific process that caused the deadlock', 'd) all of the mentioned']",a) the set of processes that have been deadlocked,b) the set of processes in the deadlock queue,c) the specific process that caused the deadlock,d) all of the mentioned,a,None.
