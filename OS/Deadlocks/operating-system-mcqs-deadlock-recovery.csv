1,A deadlock can be broken by ____________,"['a) abort one or more processes to break the circular wait', 'b) abort all the process in the system', 'c) preempt all resources from all processes', 'd) none of the mentioned']",a) abort one or more processes to break the circular wait,b) abort all the process in the system,c) preempt all resources from all processes,d) none of the mentioned,a,None.
2,The two ways of aborting processes and eliminating deadlocks are ____________,"['a) Abort all deadlocked processes', 'b) Abort all processes', 'c) Abort one process at a time until the deadlock cycle is eliminated', 'd) All of the mentioned']",a) Abort all deadlocked processes,b) Abort all processes,c) Abort one process at a time until the deadlock cycle is eliminated,d) All of the mentioned,c,None.
3,"Those processes should be aborted on occurrence of a deadlock, the termination of which?","['a) is more time consuming', 'b) incurs minimum cost', 'c) safety is not hampered', 'd) all of the mentioned']",a) is more time consuming,b) incurs minimum cost,c) safety is not hampered,d) all of the mentioned,b,None.
4,The process to be aborted is chosen on the basis of the following factors?,"['a) priority of the process', 'b) process is interactive or batch', 'c) how long the process has computed', 'd) all of the mentioned']",a) priority of the process,b) process is interactive or batch,c) how long the process has computed,d) all of the mentioned,d,None.
5,Cost factors for process termination include ____________,"['a) Number of resources the deadlock process is not holding', 'b) CPU utilization at the time of deadlock', 'c) Amount of time a deadlocked process has thus far consumed during its execution', 'd) All of the mentioned']",a) Number of resources the deadlock process is not holding,b) CPU utilization at the time of deadlock,c) Amount of time a deadlocked process has thus far consumed during its execution,d) All of the mentioned,c,None.
6,"If we preempt a resource from a process, the process cannot continue with its normal execution and it must be ____________","['a) aborted', 'b) rolled back', 'c) terminated', 'd) queued']",a) aborted,b) rolled back,c) terminated,d) queued,b,None.
7,"To _______ to a safe state, the system needs to keep more information about the states of processes","['a) abort the process', 'b) roll back the process', 'c) queue the process', 'd) none of the mentioned']",a) abort the process,b) roll back the process,c) queue the process,d) none of the mentioned,b,None.
8,If the resources are always preempted from the same process __________ can occur,"['a) deadlock', 'b) system crash', 'c) aging', 'd) starvation']",a) deadlock,b) system crash,c) aging,d) starvation,d,None.
9,What is the solution to starvation?,"['a) the number of rollbacks must be included in the cost factor', 'b) the number of resources must be included in resource preemption', 'c) resource preemption be done instead', 'd) all of the mentioned']",a) the number of rollbacks must be included in the cost factor,b) the number of resources must be included in resource preemption,c) resource preemption be done instead,d) all of the mentioned,a,None.
